# Alien Attack Game

A project for my CS2113 (Software Development) course written in Java in the Fall 2018 semester.

# Project Description

The objective of the project was to create a simple game using basic Java graphics as well as a game engine to use to step through time. The game must increase in difficulty as time continues as well as save the top 10 scores.

# Usage Instructions

If you would like to test the project for yourself, you can clone the repo and (from within the `alien-attack-game` root folder) run `javac src/AlienAttack.java` to compile and `java src/AlienAttack` to run the game.

# Customizing Game Properties

You can customize how the game plays by changing the values in the `src/resources/AlienAttack.properties` file.
